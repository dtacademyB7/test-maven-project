-------------------------
 - testng.xml - a central file in TestNG framework that helps us organize, configure and run our tests in a specific manner.
 - testng.xml file hierarchy - suite -> test -> classes -> class -> methods
 - @BeforeTest / @AfterTest -> runs before/after subgroup of tests which is represented by <test> tag.
 - @BeforeMethod / @AfterMethod -> runs before/after each @Test annotated method.
 - default run order of tests within a class - alphabetical based on the name of the methods
 - priority - a parameter that can be applied to @Test annotation that sets the run order/priority.

--------------------------
 - when running group tests, the @Before and @After methods are not going to run by default and we need to add alwaysRun = true
 - Hard Assertions: are your regular Assert class's assert methods that will stop the execution of the test as soon as they fail
 - Why parametrize tests? -> To run the same test with different input -> data-driven testing(DDT) -> to increase test coverage
 - Data-driven testing -> way of organizing your tests where test case data is separated from the test case logic in order to run the same test script with different sets of data
