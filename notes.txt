 - testng.xml - a central file in TestNG framework that helps us organize, configure and run our tests in a specific manner.
 - testng.xml file hierarchy - suite -> test -> classes -> class -> methods
 - @BeforeTest / @AfterTest -> runs before/after subgroup of tests which is represented by <test> tag.
 - @BeforeMethod / @AfterMethod -> runs before/after each @Test annotated method.
 - default run order of tests within a class - alphabetical based on the name of the methods
 - priority - a parameter that can be applied to @Test annotation that sets the run order/priority.
